        <h2>Hamlet</h2>

        <h3>Act 3</h3>

        <h4>Scene 1</h4>
        
        <p>To be, or not to be, that is the question.<br>
        Is it nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
        The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune<br>
        Or to fight against a sea of troubles,<br>
        And end them by fighting? To die, to sleep,<br>
        Nothing more, and by sleeping, to be able to say we end<br>
        The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks<br>
        That the body gets as part of life is an ending<br>
        To be wished for very earnestly. To die, to sleep,<br>
        To sleep! Perhaps to dream. Yes, there's the catch,<br>
        For what dreams may come in that sleep of death,<br>
        When we have left this life on earth,<br>
        Must make us stop. There's the respect<br>
        That makes a mess of long life,<br>
        For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
        The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's insults,<br>
        The pangs of rejected love, the law's delay,<br>
        The inexperience of office, and the disdain<br>
        That patient merit takes from the unworthy,<br>
        When he himself might his final settlement make<br>
        With a bare, sharp knife? Who would bear these burdens<br>
        To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>
        Except that the dread of something after death,<br>
        The undiscovered country, from whose borders<br>
        No traveler returns, puzzles the mind,<br>
        And makes us bear those problems we have<br>
        Rather than fly to others that we don't know about?<br>
        In this way, a conscience can make cowards of us all,<br>
        And in this way the natural color of making up your mind<br>
        Is covered with the pale shadow of thinking,<br>
        And projects of great substance and significance,<br>
        And in this regard, their movement turns erratic,<br>
        And lose the name of action. Wait!<br>
        The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in your eyes<br>
        May all my sins be remembered.</p>
